        <h1><u>Nike Air Force Sneakers</u></h1>
        <p>Introducing to you one of Nike's biggest achievemnts is the Nike Air Force. The Air Force is a range of athletic shoes made by Nike that began with the Air Force 1[1] and went on to include the Air Force 2, Air Force 3, Air Force STS, Air Force 5, Air Force XXV and Air Force 09. The Air Force 1 was created by designer Bruce Kilgore. Over the past few years, the Nike Air Force 1 has experienced a resurgence in popularity. This is mainly due to fashion constantly recycling. As the sneaker started to fly off shelves once again, more and more brands began to flock to Nike and collaborate with the famed shoe. The Air Force 1 (or AF1 or AF-1) was never originally called the Air Force. Bruce Kilgore designed the shoe. The name is a reference to Air Force One, the plane that carries the President of the United States. The shoes are sold in 5 different styles, low, mid, superlow, high and super high. The mid comes with a connected strap. The high-top Air Force 1s come with a velcro strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also referred to as "white on white"), the second most common being solid black ("black on black"). These sneakers were the coolest and still are even in 2020.</p>
